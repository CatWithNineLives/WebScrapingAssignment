# WebScrapingAssignment
Web scraping assinment

A web scraping script to fill a form on a publicly hosted website and scrape the information available in a table, as a JSON file. 
The captcha was being taken as a manual input from the user after looking at the automated window opened by chromedriver as this was a prerequisite of the assignment.

The stack is Python 3 and Selenium.

Will use tesseract to read the captcha and finish this solely using requests. I should also try and run my own ML code for reading the captcha.
